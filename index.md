Hello! My name is Youngil (Steve) Ko. I am a first-year Ph.D. student working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/kazukimaeda/">Kazuki Maeda</a> in the <b>Maeda Research Group</b> at Purdue Universityâ€™s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics. 
</p> 

<p> 
My research focuses on the computational modeling of complex reactive flows using high-performance computing, with applications in aerospace engineering. In particular, I am interested in developing accurate numerical models to capture the physics of <b>nonequilibrium gas dynamics</b> in extreme flow environments. 
</p> 

<p> 
I received both my B.S. and M.S. degrees from KAIST. For my M.S., I conducted research on Atmosphere Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) and gas-surface interactions with Professor <a href="https://kngpdl.kaist.ac.kr/">Eunji Jun</a>.
