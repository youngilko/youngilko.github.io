 Hello! My name is Youngil (Steve) Ko. I am a M.S student at the <a href="https://kngpdl.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST Non-equilibrium Gas and Plasma Dynamics Lab</a>, led by Professor Eunji Jun.
</p>


<p>
 My research is centered around exploring the intricacies of <b>nonequilibrium gas and plasma dynamics</b>. More specifically, I have a keen interest in developing models for <b>gas-surface interactions</b>, a crucial element in predicting surface properties within environments characterized by extreme flows.
</p>


<p>
 During my undergraduate research, I conducted preliminary studies on the Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) system. My role included developing a 0D global plasma model for the ABEP discharge chamber to predict its performance. Currently, I am working on advancing the <b>finite-rate surface chemistry model</b> for extreme nonequilibrium flow conditions using the <b>Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)</b> method.
</p>


<p>
 My goal is to investigate and numerically model the complex physics of <b>gas-surface interactions (GSI) and plasma-surface interactions (PSI)</b> in nonequilibrum flows. Furthermore, I plan to extend state-of-the-art numerical flow solvers to incorporate these phenomena for practical engineering applications.
